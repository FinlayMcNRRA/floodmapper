# Querying and Visualising Available Data

Querying and visualising available data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat
8/9 can be done through Google Earth Engine, which has a convenient
Python interface. The following notebok is used for this purpose:

 * [04_Query_Available_Data.ipynb](04_Query_Available_Data.ipynb)

At the end of this notebook we will have an understanding of what data
is available for our area of interest and which days are affected by
cloud cover. This will help us choose date-ranges to command mapping.
