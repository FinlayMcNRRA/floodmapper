# Querying and Visualising Available Data

Querying and visualising available data from Sentinel-2 and Landsat
8/9 can be done through Google Earth Engine, which has a convenient
Python interface. The following notebook provides functions to query
what Sentinel-2 and Landsat data is available on the Earth Engine
repositories, and to plot the data on base maps.

 * [04_Query_Available_Data.ipynb](04_Query_Available_Data.ipynb)

At the end of this notebook, users will have an understanding of what
data is available for the areas of interest, which days are affected
by cloud cover and an overall understanding of data quality. This
information will help in choosing date-ranges to command mapping.
